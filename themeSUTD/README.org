* SUTD beamer Theme
Simplistic, modern looking beamer theme that I use for my talks. To use in your beamer presentation, include it as following:

=\input{../misc/SUTD-light}=

=\AtBeginSection[]{\begin{frame}<beamer>\frametitle{}\LARGE\insertsectionhead\vspace{0.1cm}\hrule\end{frame}}=

=\usetheme{default}=

I plan to convert this to a proper theme when I have time (tm).
