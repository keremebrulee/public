* SUTD beamer Theme
Simplistic, modern looking beamer theme that I use for my talks. You will need to adapt a path to the logo (if you use it) manually. 

To use the theme in your beamer presentation, include it as following:

#+begin_src latex
\input{./SUTD-light}
\AtBeginSection[]{\begin{frame}<beamer>\frametitle{}\LARGE\insertsectionhead\vspace{0.1cm}\hrule\end{frame}}
\usetheme{default}
#+end_src
I plan to convert this to a proper theme when I have time (tm).
